# CMD01 - TCC - IBM Quantum Hardware Usage

## üìÇ Description

This repository contains practical experiments on the IBM Quantum platform, focusing on the implementation and execution of the order finding algorithm‚Äîa key component of Shor's algorithm for integer factorization. The notebook explores both theoretical and practical aspects, including modular exponentiation, quantum Fourier transform (QFT), and execution on real quantum hardware.

## ‚öõÔ∏è About the Project

The notebook `0_sampler.ipynb` demonstrates:
- Loading environment variables and authenticating with IBM Quantum.
- Selecting the least busy real backend for execution.
- Running basic quantum circuits (Hadamard gate measurement).
- Querying backend qubit counts and operational status.
- Building modular exponentiation gates and QFT circuits.
- Constructing and executing the order finding circuit, including:
  - Modular multiplication gates
  - Quantum Fourier Transform
  - Measurement and result analysis
- Executing the order finding algorithm on real IBM Quantum hardware and simulators.
- Processing results to estimate the order using continued fractions.

## üìñ Theory

The order finding algorithm is a central part of Shor's algorithm, which enables efficient integer factorization using quantum computers. The notebook includes:
- Construction of modular multiplication gates
- Implementation of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT)
- Use of continued fractions to estimate the order from quantum measurements

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- IBM Quantum account with API access
- Packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
  - qiskit
